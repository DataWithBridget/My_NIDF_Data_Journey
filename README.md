* Author: Chioma (Bridget) Nwankwo
* Project Duration: April 2025
* Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Excel
* Data Source: CHD NIDF (2020–2024)


“In 2017, I sat for my JAMB exam dreaming of a BSc. in Economics. That same year, Nigeria's first infrastructure debt fund was born. Fast forward to 2025, I began asking— **"How has this fund performed over time, and what does it mean for an investor?"**

### Project Overview
This repository explores the performance of the Nigeria Infrastructure Debt Fund (NIDF) from 2020 to 2024 using real quarterly data. It simulates a systematic investment strategy over this period alongside analysis of key fund trends:
* Net Asset Value (NAV)
* Dividend payouts
* Yield patterns
* Fund growth trajectory
* Units in Issue
 
### Objectives
* Track the quarterly performance of the NIDF from 2020–2024.
* Simulate a recurring investment habit using a fictional investor profile.
* Compare capital invested vs. total returns and income received.

### Why This Project Matters
The NIDF isn’t just about financial metrics—it tells a story of progress:
* Infrastructure Financing: Shows how debt capital can meet Nigeria’s pressing infrastructure needs.
* Retail Investment Case: Demonstrates the value of patient capital for local investors.
* Policy and Private Sector Synergy: Reflects successful public-private_partnership (PPP).
