## Background

In 2017, I sat for my JAMB exam dreaming of a BSc. in Economics. That same year, Nigeria’s first Infrastructure Debt Fund (NIDF) was launched. Currently the NIDF has been listed on the NGX.
Fast forward to 2025, curiosity led me to begin analysing the fund, first through my own eyes, and then by simulating other investor types.

This repository documents my journey in two phases:

---

## **Project 1: NIDF and Me**

The first project looks inward, answering:

> *“If I had invested in NIDF consistently since 2020, how would my portfolio have grown?”*

### **Key focus areas**:

* Quarterly NAV trends and dividend payouts
* Simulated recurring investment strateg per quarter)
* Comparison of capital invested vs. total returns
* Understanding yield patterns and fund growth trajectory

This project set the foundation for understanding the fund’s behaviour over time and the potential for patient retail investing.

## **Project 2: NIDF and You**

The second project expands outward, exploring how *different investor archetypes* might experience the fund when combined with other options like FGNSB (Federal Government Savings Bonds) and a savings account.

### **Investor profiles simulated**:

* Amara — Conservative cash saver
* Tejiro — FGNSB only bondholder
* David — NIDF dividend reinvestor
* Iornum, Ewan, Obongawan, Olayinmika — Balanced portfolios with varying allocations

### **Key focus areas**:

* Comparative simulations of multiple strategies (2020–2025)
* Reinvestment behaviours (none, partial, full)
* Visual growth trajectories and behavioural insights
* Combined analysis of NIDF data with FGNSB coupon rates

This phase moves the conversation from *“me”* to *“us”*, showing how behaviour, not just markets, shapes investment outcomes.

### Why This Journey Matters

* **Infrastructure Financing:** Demonstrates how retail investors can participate in Nigeria’s infrastructure growth.
* **Investor Education:** Breaks down bonds and fund mechanics into relatable narratives.
* **Behavioural Insights:** Highlights the real impact of patience, risk appetite, and reinvestment decisions on wealth building.
